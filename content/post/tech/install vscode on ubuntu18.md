Visual Studio Code is an open source cross-platform code editor developed by Microsoft. It has a built-in debugging support, embedded Git control, syntax highlighting, code completion, integrated terminal, code refactoring and snippets.

The easiest and recommended way to install Visual Studio Code on Ubuntu machines is to enable the VS Code repository and install the VS Code package through the command line.

Although this tutorial is written for Ubuntu 18.04 the same steps can be used for Ubuntu 16.04.
